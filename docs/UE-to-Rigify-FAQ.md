### How can I share a template I created with another artist?
Go to Edit > Preferences > Addons > UE to Rigify and select ‘Export Template’. From the sidebar in the file window select the template you want to export. Then select the location on your hard drive and click ‘Export Template’. They can now click ‘Import Template’ and select this file, then click ‘Import Template’.
