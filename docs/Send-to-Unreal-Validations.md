## Text:

### Check if asset has unused materials:

If this option is on it looks at each material index on the object and it checks if that material is assigned to a vertex on the mesh object. If there is a unused material, then an error message is thrown to the user.


### Check texture references:

If a texture referenced in an objectâ€™s material can not be found in the blend file data than a error message is thrown to the user.
