However, instead of isolating this from the tool, we want to create a free ecosystem of extensions. As this grows overtime, we want this page to be filled with links to extensions that the community has authored, and can hopefully help others customize their blender unreal pipelines.</p><h2 id="guidelines" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#guidelines" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Guidelines</h2><p>In order to have your extension linked to this page, several requirements must be met.</p><h3 id="requirements" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#requirements" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Requirements</h3><ul><li>Code must be in a public GitHub repo</li><li>Must have a link to publicly available documentation or a README</li><li>Must have passing test cases when run in the Send to Unreal testing environment</li></ul><h3 id="notice" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#notice" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Notice</h3><p>We reserve the right to remove your extension link from this page for these or any other reasons:</p><ul><li>Out of date code that no longer runs with the latest supported version of Send to Unreal.</li><li>Malicious or suspicious activity</li></ul><h3 id="liability" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#liability" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Liability</h3><p>This page is a list of community extensions that you are free to explore, but we do not support them in any way.
